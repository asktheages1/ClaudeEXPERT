## Hook events

Each event corresponds to a point in Claude Code's lifecycle where hooks can run. The sections below are ordered to match the lifecycle: from session setup through the agentic loop to session end. Each section describes when the event fires, what matchers it supports, the JSON input it receives, and how to control behavior through output.

### SessionStart

Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session. Useful for loading development context like existing issues or recent changes to your codebase, or setting up environment variables. For static context that doesn't require a script, use [CLAUDE.md](/docs/en/memory) instead.

SessionStart runs on every session, so keep these hooks fast. Only `type: "command"` and `type: "mcp_tool"` hooks are supported. See [MCP tool hook fields](#mcp-tool-hook-fields) for when `mcp_tool` hooks run.

The matcher value corresponds to how the session was initiated:

| Matcher | When it fires |
| :- | :- |
| `startup` | New session |
| `resume` | `--resume`, `--continue`, or `/resume` |
| `clear` | `/clear` |
| `compact` | Auto or manual compaction |
| `fork` | A new session forked from an existing one: `--fork-session` with `--resume` or `--continue`, the `/fork` background copy, `/branch`, or a conversation you [move to the background](/docs/en/agent-view#from-inside-a-session) |

Before v2.1.214, forked sessions reported source `"resume"`.

When you start an interactive session, resume a conversation at launch with `--continue` or `--resume`, or run `/clear`, SessionStart hooks run in the background. You can type right away, and a conversation you resumed appears without waiting for the hooks. Claude's first response still waits for the hooks to finish, so their context reaches Claude.

When you switch conversations with `/resume` inside a session, the switch waits for the hooks to finish instead. If you run `/clear` or switch to another conversation while background hooks are still running, nothing they return applies to the session.

The same wait applies at launch, including a resumed session: a prompt you send while SessionStart hooks are still running doesn't reach Claude until they finish.

During either wait, press `Esc` to take the prompt back into the input without sending it. The hooks keep running.

#### SessionStart input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), SessionStart hooks receive `source` and optionally `model`, `agent_type`, and `session_title`:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `source` | How the session started: `"startup"` for new sessions, `"resume"` for resumed sessions, `"clear"` after `/clear`, `"compact"` after compaction, or `"fork"` for a new session forked from an existing one |
| `model` | The active model identifier. It can be omitted, for example after `/clear` or when a session is restored through conversation recovery, so check for the field before reading it |
| `agent_type` | The agent name, present when you start Claude Code with `claude --agent <name>` |
| `session_title` | The session's custom title, present when one is set, for example with `--name`, `/rename`, a hook's `sessionTitle` output, or the Agent SDK's `renameSession()`. A hook that emits `sessionTitle` can check this field first to avoid overwriting an existing custom title |

A session you haven't named can still have a [generated title](/docs/en/sessions#name-your-sessions). That title isn't a custom title and doesn't appear in `session_title`.

When `source` is `"resume"` or `"fork"` and the transcript contains at least one response from Claude, SessionStart hooks also receive the four fields below. Your hook can use them to report what resuming a stale conversation costs before the first request, for example in a [`systemMessage`](#json-output). These fields require Claude Code v2.1.251 or later.

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `seconds_since_last_response` | Wall-clock seconds since the last response in the resumed transcript |
| `context_tokens` | Tokens the first request of the resumed session re-sends as its prompt |
| `prompt_cache_likely_expired` | `true` when the last response is older than the session's [prompt cache lifetime](/docs/en/prompt-caching#cache-lifetime) or a later compaction replaced the cached conversation |
| `estimated_cache_write_usd` | Estimated cost in US dollars of writing `context_tokens` to the prompt cache on the session's model, excluding the response |

This example shows the input for a session resumed 90 minutes after its last response:

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionStart",
  "source": "resume",
  "model": "claude-opus-5",
  "seconds_since_last_response": 5400,
  "context_tokens": 182340,
  "prompt_cache_likely_expired": true,
  "estimated_cache_write_usd": 1.1396
}
```

#### SessionStart decision control

Claude Code adds stdout it [treats as plain text](#exit-code-0) to Claude's context. In addition to the [JSON output fields](#json-output) available to all hooks, you can return these event-specific fields:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `additionalContext` | String added to Claude's context at the start of the conversation, before the first prompt. See [Add context for Claude](#add-context-for-claude) for how the text is delivered and what to put in it |
| `initialUserMessage` | String used as the first user message of the session. Applies in [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag, where it becomes the first turn even if no prompt is provided. If a prompt is provided, it follows as the next turn. Unlike `additionalContext`, which attaches to an existing turn, this creates the turn |
| `sessionTitle` | Sets the session title, with the same effect as `/rename`. Use to name sessions automatically from the launch folder, git branch, or worktree name. Applies when `source` is `"startup"`, `"resume"`, or `"fork"`; ignored on `"clear"` and `"compact"` |
| `watchPaths` | Array of absolute paths to watch for [FileChanged](#filechanged) events during this session |
| `reloadSkills` | Boolean. When `true`, Claude Code re-scans the [skill](/docs/en/skills) and command directories after the SessionStart hooks complete, so skills the hook installed are available in the same session, starting with the first prompt |

```json theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "Current branch: feat/auth-refactor\nUncommitted changes: src/auth.ts, src/login.tsx\nActive issue: #4211 Migrate to OAuth2",
    "sessionTitle": "auth-refactor"
  }
}
```

Since plain stdout already reaches Claude for this event, a hook that only loads context can print to stdout directly without building JSON. Use the JSON form when you need to combine context with other fields such as `sessionTitle`.

Use `reloadSkills` when a SessionStart hook installs or updates skills. Skill discovery normally runs before SessionStart hooks finish, so files the hook writes into `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` would otherwise only appear in the next session. This example syncs a shared skills repository and requests the re-scan:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

git -C ~/.claude/skills/team-skills pull --quiet 2>/dev/null || \
  git clone --quiet https://git.example.com/your-org/team-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/team-skills

echo '{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "SessionStart", "reloadSkills": true}}'
```

The repository URL is a placeholder; replace it with your own skills repository. With the placeholder, the clone fails and prints a `fatal:` message to stderr. Stderr from a SessionStart hook that exits 0 is informational only, so the `reloadSkills` request still applies.

#### Persist environment variables

SessionStart hooks have access to the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable, which provides a file path where you can persist environment variables for subsequent Bash commands.

To set individual environment variables, write `export` statements to `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`. Use append (`>>`) to preserve variables set by other hooks:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  echo 'export NODE_ENV=production' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
  echo 'export DEBUG_LOG=true' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
  echo 'export PATH="$PATH:./node_modules/.bin"' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi

exit 0
```

To capture all environment changes from setup commands, compare the exported variables before and after:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

ENV_BEFORE=$(export -p | sort)

# Run your setup commands that modify the environment
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use 20

if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  ENV_AFTER=$(export -p | sort)
  comm -13 <(echo "$ENV_BEFORE") <(echo "$ENV_AFTER") >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi

exit 0
```

<Note>
  `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is available for SessionStart, [Setup](#setup), [CwdChanged](#cwdchanged), and [FileChanged](#filechanged) hooks. Other hook types don't have access to this variable.
</Note>

### Setup

Fires only when you launch Claude Code with `--init-only`, or with `--init` or `--maintenance` in [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag. It doesn't fire on normal startup. Use it for one-time dependency installation or scheduled cleanup that you trigger explicitly from CI or scripts, separate from normal session startup. For per-session initialization, use [SessionStart](#sessionstart) instead.

The matcher value corresponds to the CLI flag that triggered the hook:

| Matcher | When it fires |
| :- | :- |
| `init` | `claude --init-only` or `claude -p --init` |
| `maintenance` | `claude -p --maintenance` |

When you run `claude --init-only`, Claude Code runs Setup hooks and `SessionStart` hooks with the `startup` matcher, then exits without starting a conversation.

When you start or continue a conversation with `-p`, you also need to supply a prompt, as an argument or piped on stdin. You can skip the prompt when a `SessionStart` hook supplies [`initialUserMessage`](#sessionstart-decision-control) or when you resume a session with a [deferred tool call](#defer-a-tool-call-for-later).

On success, `--init-only` prints nothing to the terminal. To confirm the hooks ran, start with `claude --debug-file <path> --init-only`, replacing `<path>` with a log file location, and check the log for the Setup and SessionStart hook entries.

Because Setup doesn't fire on every launch, a plugin that needs a dependency installed can't rely on Setup alone. The practical pattern is to check for the dependency on first use and install on miss, for example a hook or skill that tests for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/node_modules` and runs `npm install` if absent. See the [persistent data directory](/docs/en/plugins/components#path-variables-and-persistent-data) for where to store installed dependencies. If you distribute your plugin through a marketplace, you may not need this pattern: Claude Code [installs eligible Node.js package dependencies automatically](/docs/en/plugins/loading#node-js-package-dependencies) when it caches the plugin.

#### Setup input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), Setup hooks receive a `trigger` field set to either `"init"` or `"maintenance"`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "Setup",
  "trigger": "init"
}
```

#### Setup decision control

Setup hooks can't block; execution continues on any exit code. On every exit code, Claude Code discards a Setup hook's [JSON output fields](#json-output), such as `systemMessage`, `continue`, and `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. With `-p`, a Setup hook's stdout, stderr, and exit code appear in the run's output only as [`hook_response` events](/docs/en/headless#read-session-metadata) when you launch with `--output-format stream-json --verbose`.

Setup hooks have access to `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`. Variables written to that file persist into subsequent Bash commands for the session, as in [SessionStart hooks](#persist-environment-variables). Only `type: "command"` hooks run on `Setup`. A `type: "mcp_tool"` hook on `Setup` is always skipped, as described under [MCP tool hook fields](#mcp-tool-hook-fields).

### InstructionsLoaded

Fires when a `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/rules/*.md` file is loaded into context. This event fires at session start for eagerly loaded files and again later when files are lazily loaded, for example when Claude accesses a subdirectory that contains a nested `CLAUDE.md` or when conditional rules with `paths:` frontmatter match. The hook doesn't support blocking or decision control. It runs asynchronously for observability purposes.

This event doesn't fire when Claude [reads `AGENTS.md` directly](/docs/en/memory#agents-md) through the **Project instructions** setting. It does fire when a `CLAUDE.md` imports your `AGENTS.md`, with `load_reason` set to `include` as for any other imported file, and when `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, as a normal `CLAUDE.md` load.

The matcher runs against `load_reason`. For example, use `"matcher": "session_start"` to fire only for files loaded at session start, or `"matcher": "path_glob_match|nested_traversal"` to fire only for lazy loads.

#### InstructionsLoaded input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), InstructionsLoaded hooks receive these fields:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `file_path` | Absolute path to the instruction file that was loaded |
| `memory_type` | Scope of the file: `"User"`, `"Project"`, `"Local"`, or `"Managed"` |
| `load_reason` | Why the file was loaded: `"session_start"`, `"nested_traversal"`, `"path_glob_match"`, `"include"`, or `"compact"`. The `"compact"` value fires when instruction files are re-loaded after a compaction event |
| `globs` | Path glob patterns from the file's `paths:` frontmatter, if any. Present only for `path_glob_match` loads |
| `trigger_file_path` | Path to the file whose access triggered this load, for lazy loads |
| `parent_file_path` | Path to the parent instruction file that included this one, for `include` loads |

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/my-project",
  "hook_event_name": "InstructionsLoaded",
  "file_path": "/Users/my-project/CLAUDE.md",
  "memory_type": "Project",
  "load_reason": "session_start"
}
```

#### InstructionsLoaded decision control

InstructionsLoaded hooks have no decision control. They can't block or modify instruction loading. Claude Code discards their [JSON output fields](#json-output), such as `systemMessage` and `continue`. Use this event for audit logging, compliance tracking, or observability.

### UserPromptSubmit

Runs when a prompt is submitted, before Claude processes it. This allows you
to add additional context based on the prompt/conversation, validate prompts, or
block certain types of prompts.

`UserPromptSubmit` hooks don't fire only on prompts you type. Claude Code also runs them on:

* A [scheduled task](/docs/en/scheduled-tasks) firing, including a `/loop` iteration
* A [background subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents#run-subagents-in-foreground-or-background) reporting back to the session that started it
* A [message another session sends](/docs/en/cross-session-messaging) to your main conversation

`UserPromptSubmit` hooks have a default timeout of 30 seconds for `command`, `http`, and `mcp_tool` types, shorter than the 600-second default for those types on most other events. Because this hook runs before every prompt and blocks model processing until it completes, a stuck hook stalls the session. If your hook needs more time, set the `timeout` field in the hook entry.

Apart from a command hook you run with [`async: true`](#run-hooks-in-the-background), a `UserPromptSubmit` command, HTTP, or MCP tool hook that reaches its timeout is canceled and its output, including any `additionalContext`, is discarded. The prompt still reaches Claude without that context. The transcript shows a notice naming the hook, the timeout that fired, and that the output was discarded.

An [Agent SDK callback hook](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks) on `UserPromptSubmit` that reaches its timeout blocks the prompt with a message naming the hook and the timeout, because a callback there can be acting as a policy gate that must not fail open. The session continues. Before v2.1.208, a callback timeout on that event ended the turn with an execution error.

#### UserPromptSubmit input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), UserPromptSubmit hooks receive the `prompt` field containing the submitted text. Pasted content that collapsed to a `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder arrives expanded in place. In sessions where Claude Code [marks pasted text for Claude](/docs/en/terminal-config#how-claude-treats-pasted-text), that expanded content sits between a `<pasted_content id="…">` line and a `</pasted_content id="…">` line, so account for those lines if your hook parses the prompt.

UserPromptSubmit hooks also receive `session_title` when the session has a custom title, with the same meaning as the [SessionStart `session_title` field](#sessionstart-input).

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "prompt": "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
}
```

#### UserPromptSubmit decision control

`UserPromptSubmit` hooks can control whether a submitted prompt is processed and add context. All [JSON output fields](#json-output) are available.

There are two ways to add context to the conversation on exit code 0:

* **Plain text stdout**: Claude Code adds stdout it [treats as plain text](#exit-code-0) to Claude's context
* **JSON with `additionalContext`**: use the JSON format below for more control. The `additionalContext` field is added as context

Neither channel produces a visible transcript entry. Plain stdout and the `additionalContext` value are each injected as a system reminder that starts with the hook's name; Claude reads both. To confirm delivery, check the [debug log](#debug-hooks).

To block a prompt, return a JSON object with `decision` set to `"block"`:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `decision` | `"block"` stops the prompt before it reaches Claude. Omit to allow the prompt to proceed |
| `reason` | Shown to the user when `decision` is `"block"`. Not added to context |
| `additionalContext` | String added to Claude's context alongside the submitted prompt. See [Add context for Claude](#add-context-for-claude) |
| `sessionTitle` | Sets the session title. Use to name sessions automatically based on the prompt content |
| `suppressOriginalPrompt` | If `true` when the hook blocks the prompt, leaves the prompt text out of the block message. See [What a blocked prompt leaves behind](#what-a-blocked-prompt-leaves-behind) |

A hook that blocks by exiting 2 routes the same way as `reason`: the block message shows the stderr text to the user, and it isn't added to context.

```json theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Explanation for decision",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "My additional context here",
    "sessionTitle": "My session title",
    "suppressOriginalPrompt": true
  }
}
```

#### What a blocked prompt leaves behind

A blocked prompt never reaches Claude, but its text isn't removed everywhere. By default the block message shown to the user ends with `Original prompt:` followed by the submitted text, and Claude Code writes that message to the session's transcript file on disk. To leave the text out of the message, print JSON with `"suppressOriginalPrompt": true` inside `hookSpecificOutput`. This works whether the hook blocks with `decision: "block"` or by exiting 2.

`suppressOriginalPrompt` changes only the block message. The submitted text can still appear in local files such as the session transcript and your prompt history, so a blocking hook isn't a way to keep a secret off disk. To limit or remove those files, see [Plaintext storage](/docs/en/claude-directory#plaintext-storage) and [Clear local data](/docs/en/claude-directory#clear-local-data).

### UserPromptExpansion

Runs when a user-typed command expands into a prompt before reaching Claude. Use this to block specific commands from direct invocation, inject context for a particular skill, or log which commands users invoke. For example, a hook matching `deploy` can block `/deploy` unless an approval file is present, or a hook matching a review skill can append the team's review checklist as `additionalContext`.

This event covers the path `PreToolUse` doesn't: a `PreToolUse` hook matching the `Skill` tool fires only when Claude calls the tool, but typing `/skillname` directly bypasses `PreToolUse`. `UserPromptExpansion` fires on that direct path.

Matches on `command_name`. Leave the matcher empty to fire on every prompt-type command.

#### UserPromptExpansion input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), UserPromptExpansion hooks receive `expansion_type`, `command_name`, `command_args`, `command_source`, and the original `prompt` string. The `expansion_type` field is `slash_command` for skill and custom commands, or `mcp_prompt` for MCP server prompts.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../00893aaf.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptExpansion",
  "expansion_type": "slash_command",
  "command_name": "example-skill",
  "command_args": "arg1 arg2",
  "command_source": "plugin",
  "prompt": "/example-skill arg1 arg2"
}
```

#### UserPromptExpansion decision control

`UserPromptExpansion` hooks can block the expansion or add context. All [JSON output fields](#json-output) are available.

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `decision` | `"block"` prevents the command from expanding. Omit to allow it to proceed |
| `reason` | Shown to the user when `decision` is `"block"` |
| `additionalContext` | String added to Claude's context alongside the expanded prompt. See [Add context for Claude](#add-context-for-claude) |

A hook that blocks by exiting 2 routes the same way as `reason`: the block message shows the stderr text to the user.

```json theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "This slash command is not available",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptExpansion",
    "additionalContext": "Additional context for this expansion"
  }
}
```
