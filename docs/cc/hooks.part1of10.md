# Hooks reference

> Reference for Claude Code hook events, configuration schema, JSON input/output formats, exit codes, async hooks, HTTP hooks, prompt hooks, and MCP tool hooks.

<Tip>
  For a quickstart guide with examples, see [Automate actions with hooks](/docs/en/hooks-guide).
</Tip>

Hooks are user-defined shell commands, HTTP endpoints, MCP tool calls, LLM prompts, or subagents that execute automatically at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. Claude Code fires the same hook events wherever it runs: sessions in the terminal, IDE extensions, the [Desktop app](/docs/en/desktop-quickstart), and [cloud sessions](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web). Use this reference to look up event schemas, configuration options, JSON input/output formats, and advanced features like async hooks, HTTP hooks, and MCP tool hooks.

A plugin can also register hooks as JavaScript functions that Claude Code calls in its own process, which can draw in the interface as well as act on events. A plugin that does is a [mod](/docs/en/plugins/mods/overview), and those function hooks are covered in [React to events](/docs/en/plugins/mods/events) rather than here. The hooks on this page keep working alongside mods.

## Hook lifecycle

Claude Code runs hooks at specific points during a session. When an event fires and a matcher matches, Claude Code passes JSON context about the event to your hook handler. For command hooks, input arrives on stdin. For HTTP hooks, it arrives as the POST request body. Your handler can then inspect the input, take action, and optionally return a decision.

Events fall into three cadences:

* per session: `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd`
* per turn: `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `StopFailure`
* on every tool call inside the agentic loop: `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse`, except [`EndConversation`](/docs/en/tools-reference#endconversation-tool-behavior) calls, which skip both

</div>

The table below summarizes when each event fires. The [Hook events](#hook-events) section documents the full input schema and decision control options for each one.

| Event | When it fires |
| :- | :- |
| `SessionStart` | When a session begins or resumes |
| `Setup` | When you start Claude Code with `--init-only`, or with `--init` or `--maintenance` in `-p` mode. For one-time preparation in CI or scripts |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | When a prompt is submitted, before Claude processes it. Also fires on [turns Claude Code starts on its own](/docs/en/hooks#userpromptsubmit) |
| `UserPromptExpansion` | When a user-typed command expands into a prompt, before it reaches Claude. Can block the expansion |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool call executes. Can block it |
| `PermissionRequest` | When a tool call needs a permission decision |
| `PermissionDenied` | When auto mode denies a tool call, including denials without a classifier verdict. Use JSON `hookSpecificOutput.retry: true` to tell the model it may retry the denied tool call. Claude Code ignores `retry` when the classifier produced no verdict |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool call succeeds |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After a tool call fails |
| `PostToolBatch` | After a full batch of parallel tool calls resolves, before the next model call |
| `Notification` | When Claude Code sends a notification |
| `MessageDisplay` | While assistant message text is displayed |
| `SubagentStart` | When a subagent is spawned |
| `SubagentStop` | When a subagent finishes |
| `TaskCreated` | When a task is being created via `TaskCreate` |
| `TaskCompleted` | When a task is being marked as completed |
| `Stop` | When Claude finishes responding |
| `StopFailure` | When the turn ends due to an API error |
| `TeammateIdle` | When an [agent team](/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate is about to go idle |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | When a CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/*.md` file is loaded into context. Fires at session start and when files are lazily loaded during a session |
| `ConfigChange` | When a configuration file changes during a session |
| `CwdChanged` | When the working directory changes, for example when Claude executes a `cd` command. Useful for reactive environment management with tools like direnv |
| `DirectoryAdded` | When a working directory is added mid-session via `/add-dir` or the SDK `register_repo_root` control request |
| `FileChanged` | When a watched file changes on disk. The `matcher` field specifies which filenames to watch |
| `WorktreeCreate` | When a worktree is being created via `--worktree`, `isolation: "worktree"`, or for a background session. Replaces default git behavior |
| `WorktreeRemove` | When a worktree that a `WorktreeCreate` hook created is being removed |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction |
| `PostCompact` | After context compaction completes |
| `PreModelSwitch` | Before Claude Code applies a model switch that you or a client requested. Can block the switch |
| `PostModelSwitch` | After the session's model changes, including changes Claude Code makes on its own, such as restoring the model when you resume a session |
| `Elicitation` | When an MCP server requests user input during a tool call |
| `ElicitationResult` | After a user responds to an MCP elicitation, before the response is sent back to the server |
| `SessionEnd` | When a session terminates |

### How a hook resolves

To see how the event, the matcher, and the handler fit together, consider this `PreToolUse` hook that blocks destructive shell commands.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
    The `matcher` narrows to Bash tool calls and the `if` condition narrows further to Bash subcommands matching `rm *`, so `block-rm.sh` only spawns when both filters match:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hooks": {
        "PreToolUse": [
          {
            "matcher": "Bash",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "type": "command",
                "if": "Bash(rm *)",
                "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/block-rm.sh",
                "args": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    The script reads the JSON input from stdin, extracts the command, and returns a `permissionDecision` of `"deny"` if it contains `rm -rf`. Save it to `.claude/hooks/block-rm.sh` in your project and make it executable with `chmod +x .claude/hooks/block-rm.sh` so Claude Code can run it:

    ```bash theme={null}
    #!/bin/bash
    # .claude/hooks/block-rm.sh
    COMMAND=$(jq -r '.tool_input.command')

    if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -q 'rm -rf'; then
      jq -n '{
        hookSpecificOutput: {
          hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
          permissionDecision: "deny",
          permissionDecisionReason: "Destructive command blocked by hook"
        }
      }'
    else
      exit 0  # no decision; normal permission flow applies
    fi
    ```

    This script, like the other Bash examples on this page that parse JSON input, uses `jq`, so install `jq` and make sure it is on your `PATH` before trying them.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
    The matcher `Bash|PowerShell` covers the [PowerShell tool](#powershell) as well as Bash. A single `if` rule matches only one tool's calls, so each tool gets its own handler: the first narrows to Bash subcommands matching `rm *`, the second to PowerShell commands matching `Remove-Item *`. Both run the same script through `powershell.exe`:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hooks": {
        "PreToolUse": [
          {
            "matcher": "Bash|PowerShell",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "type": "command",
                "if": "Bash(rm *)",
                "command": "powershell.exe",
                "args": [
                  "-NoProfile",
                  "-ExecutionPolicy",
                  "Bypass",
                  "-File",
                  "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1"
                ]
              },
              {
                "type": "command",
                "if": "PowerShell(Remove-Item *)",
                "command": "powershell.exe",
                "args": [
                  "-NoProfile",
                  "-ExecutionPolicy",
                  "Bypass",
                  "-File",
                  "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1"
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    The `-NoProfile` flag skips loading your PowerShell profile so the hook starts fast, and `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` lets PowerShell run the local script file.

    The script reads the JSON input from stdin, extracts the command, and returns a `permissionDecision` of `"deny"` if it contains `rm -rf` or `Remove-Item` followed by `-Recurse`. Save it to `.claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1` in your project:

    ```powershell theme={null}
    # .claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1
    $callInput = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd() | ConvertFrom-Json
    $command = $callInput.tool_input.command

    if ($command -match 'rm -rf|Remove-Item.*-Recurse') {
      @{
        hookSpecificOutput = @{
          hookEventName = "PreToolUse"
          permissionDecision = "deny"
          permissionDecisionReason = "Destructive command blocked by hook"
        }
      } | ConvertTo-Json
    } else {
      exit 0  # no decision; normal permission flow applies
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now suppose Claude Code decides to run `Bash "rm -rf /tmp/build"` against the macOS/Linux config. Here's what happens:

  <img src="https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/_xqph1dUOslCOwsj/images/hook-resolution-dark.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=_xqph1dUOslCOwsj&q=85&s=e80af91f8507cee6bd51ac3c2dd92f63" className="hidden dark:block" alt="Diagram of hook resolution: PreToolUse fires, the matcher checks for a Bash match, then the if condition checks for a Bash(rm *) match.

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event fires">
    The `PreToolUse` event fires. Claude Code sends the tool input as JSON on stdin to the hook:

    ```json theme={null}
    { "tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": { "command": "rm -rf /tmp/build" }, ... }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Matcher checks">
    The matcher `"Bash"` matches the tool name, so this hook group activates. If you omit the matcher or use `"*"`, the group activates on every occurrence of the event.
  </Step>

  <Step title="If condition checks">
    The `if` condition `"Bash(rm *)"` matches because `rm -rf /tmp/build` is a subcommand matching `rm *`, so this handler spawns. If the command had been `npm test`, the `if` check would fail and `block-rm.sh` would never run, avoiding the process spawn overhead. The `if` field is optional; without it, every handler in the matched group runs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hook handler runs">
    The script inspects the full command and finds `rm -rf`, so it prints a decision to stdout:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hookSpecificOutput": {
        "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
        "permissionDecision": "deny",
        "permissionDecisionReason": "Destructive command blocked by hook"
      }
    }
    ```

    If the command had been a safer `rm` variant like `rm file.txt`, the script would hit `exit 0` instead. Exit code 0 with no output means the hook has no decision to report, so the tool call continues through the normal [permission flow](/docs/en/permissions). The hook can deny the call, but staying silent doesn't approve it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude Code acts on the result">
    Claude Code reads the JSON decision, blocks the tool call, and shows Claude the reason.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The [Configuration](#configuration) section below documents the full schema, and each [hook event](#hook-events) section documents what input your command receives and what output it can return.

## Configuration

Hooks are defined in JSON settings files. The configuration has three levels of nesting:

1. Choose a [hook event](#hook-events) to respond to, like `PreToolUse` or `Stop`
2. Add a [matcher group](#matcher-patterns) to filter when it fires, like "only for the Bash tool"
3. Define one or more [hook handlers](#hook-handler-fields) to run when matched

See [How a hook resolves](#how-a-hook-resolves) above for a complete walkthrough with an annotated example.

<Note>
  This page uses specific terms for each level: **hook event** for the lifecycle point, **matcher group** for the filter, and **hook handler** for the shell command, HTTP endpoint, MCP tool, prompt, or agent that runs. "Hook" on its own refers to the general feature.
</Note>

### Hook locations

Where you define a hook determines its scope:

| Location | Scope | Shareable |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | All your projects | No, local to your machine |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Single project | Yes, can be committed to the repo |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Single project | No, gitignored when Claude Code saves a setting to it |
| Managed policy settings | Organization-wide | Yes, admin-controlled |
| [Plugin](/docs/en/plugins/overview) `hooks/hooks.json` | When plugin is enabled | Yes, bundled with the plugin |
| [Skill](/docs/en/skills) frontmatter | The rest of the session once the skill is invoked. See [Hooks in skills and agents](#hooks-in-skills-and-agents) | Yes, defined in the skill file |
| [Subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents) frontmatter | While that subagent is running | Yes, defined in the subagent file |

[Cloud sessions](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) don't read your local `~/.claude/settings.json`. In a [self-hosted environment](/docs/en/self-hosted-environments-configuration#permissions-and-tool-approval), Claude Code also runs the hooks the operator seeded from the runner host's `~/.claude/`, and it runs the hooks in the runner image's managed settings file when that file is among the [managed sources Claude Code applies](/docs/en/managed-settings#how-claude-code-combines-managed-sources), which by default means only when neither server-managed settings nor an MDM-delivered Claude Code policy supplies the managed tier. See [what carries over from your setup](/docs/en/cloud-environments#what-carries-over-from-your-setup) for which settings files and plugins, and so which hooks, reach a cloud session.

For details on settings file resolution, see [settings](/docs/en/settings).

Hooks from settings files, managed policy settings, and plugins also run inside [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents). When a subagent calls a tool, tool events such as `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` fire the same configured hooks as in the main conversation, and the input carries the `agent_id` and `agent_type` [common input fields](#common-input-fields) that identify the subagent.

Administrators can use [`allowManagedHooksOnly`](/docs/en/settings-reference#allowmanagedhooksonly) in [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings) to restrict which hooks run:

* Your user, project, local, and plugin hooks are blocked. Hooks from plugins force-enabled in managed settings `enabledPlugins` are exempt
* Claude Code also narrows your [`statusLine`](/docs/en/statusline), [`fileSuggestion`](/docs/en/settings-reference#filesuggestion), and [`subagentStatusLine`](/docs/en/statusline#subagent-status-lines) settings to managed settings
* Claude Code also disables plugins with a [`command` source](/docs/en/plugins/marketplace-reference#command-plugin-source), including plugins force-enabled in managed settings `enabledPlugins`, unless [`disableCommandPluginSources`](/docs/en/settings-reference#disablecommandpluginsources) is explicitly set to `false`. `command` sources require Claude Code v2.1.229 or later
* Claude Code also blocks marketplace [`headersHelper` commands](/docs/en/plugins/host-marketplace#authenticate-archive-downloads) unless [`disableCommandPluginSources`](/docs/en/settings-reference#disablecommandpluginsources) is explicitly set to `false`, except for a marketplace that managed settings themselves declare

See [what runs under `allowManagedHooksOnly`](/docs/en/settings-reference#what-runs-under-allowmanagedhooksonly).

Hook entries merge across settings levels rather than replacing each other: user, project, and local settings add their own hooks without removing managed ones, and the [`disableAllHooks`](#disable-or-remove-hooks) setting can't disable managed hooks from outside managed settings.

The [HTTP hook allowlists](/docs/en/settings-reference#hook-and-skill-settings) apply to hooks from every source, including managed policy settings:

* `allowedHttpHookUrls`: when defined at any settings level, Claude Code runs an HTTP hook handler only if its URL matches the merged allowlist
* `httpHookAllowedEnvVars`: when defined, Claude Code interpolates only the environment variables on that list into hook headers

### Matcher patterns

The `matcher` field filters when hooks fire. How a matcher is evaluated depends on the characters it contains:

| Matcher value | Evaluated as | Example |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `"*"`, `""`, or omitted | Match all | fires on every occurrence of the event |
| Only letters, digits, `_`, `-`, spaces, `,`, and `\|` | Exact string, or list of exact strings separated by `\|` or `,` with optional surrounding whitespace | `Bash` matches only the Bash tool; `Edit\|Write` and `Edit, Write` each match either tool exactly; `code-reviewer` matches only that agent type |
| Contains any other character | JavaScript regular expression, unanchored | `^Notebook` matches any tool whose name starts with `Notebook`; `mcp__memory__.*` matches every tool from the `memory` server |

A matcher on the regular-expression path is tested with JavaScript's `RegExp.prototype.test`, which succeeds on a match anywhere in the value. `Edit.*` matches both `Edit` and `NotebookEdit`; wrap the pattern in `^` and `$`, as in `^Edit$`, when you need a whole-string match.

`FileChanged` and `StopFailure` use a narrower exact-match set of letters, digits, `_`, and `|` only. A hyphen, space, or comma in a matcher for those two events keeps it on the regular-expression path, and only `|` separates alternatives. Every other event with matcher support in the table that follows accepts `|` or `,`.

The `FileChanged` event doesn't follow these rules when building its watch list. See [FileChanged](#filechanged).

Each event type matches on a different field:

| Event | What the matcher filters | Example matcher values |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`, `PermissionDenied` | tool name | `Bash`, `Edit\|Write`, `mcp__.*` |
| `SessionStart` | how the session started | `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`, `fork` |
| `Setup` | which CLI flag triggered setup | `init`, `maintenance` |
| `SessionEnd` | why the session ended | `clear`, `resume`, `logout`, `prompt_input_exit`, `other` |
| `Notification` | notification type | `permission_prompt`, `idle_prompt`, `auth_success`, `elicitation_dialog`, `elicitation_url_dialog`, `elicitation_complete`, `elicitation_response`, `agent_needs_input`, `agent_completed`, `quota_auto_resume_fired`, `quota_auto_resume_stale`, `quota_auto_resume_disabled` |
| `SubagentStart` | agent type | `general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, custom agent names, or plugin-scoped names like `^my-plugin:reviewer$` |
| `PreCompact`, `PostCompact` | what triggered compaction | `manual`, `auto` |
| `PreModelSwitch`, `PostModelSwitch` | canonical name of the model the session switches to, as described under [PreModelSwitch](#premodelswitch) | `claude-opus-5`, `claude-opus-4-6\|claude-opus-5`, `.*opus.*` |
| `SubagentStop` | agent type | same values as `SubagentStart` |
| `ConfigChange` | configuration source | `user_settings`, `project_settings`, `local_settings`, `policy_settings`, `skills` |
| `CwdChanged` | no matcher support | always fires on every occurrence |
| `DirectoryAdded` | how the directory was added | `slash_command`, `register_repo_root` |
| `FileChanged` | literal filenames to watch (see [FileChanged](#filechanged)) | `.envrc\|.env` |
| `StopFailure` | error type | `rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `authentication_failed`, `oauth_org_not_allowed`, `account_on_hold`, `billing_error`, `invalid_request`, `model_not_found`, `server_error`, `max_output_tokens`, `cloud_credential_error`, `unknown` |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | load reason | `session_start`, `nested_traversal`, `path_glob_match`, `include`, `compact` |
| `UserPromptExpansion` | command name | your skill or command names |
| `Elicitation` | MCP server name | your configured MCP server names |
| `ElicitationResult` | MCP server name | same values as `Elicitation` |
| `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolBatch`, `Stop`, `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove`, `MessageDisplay` | no matcher support | always fires on every occurrence |

Matching `StopFailure` on `cloud_credential_error` requires Claude Code v2.1.267 or later, the first version that reports credential-load failures under that value rather than `server_error` or `unknown`.

For most events, Claude Code evaluates the matcher against a field from the [JSON input](#hook-input-and-output) it sends to your hook on stdin. For tool events, that field is `tool_name`. For `PreModelSwitch` and `PostModelSwitch`, Claude Code evaluates the matcher against the canonical name it derives from `to_model`, as described under [PreModelSwitch](#premodelswitch). Each [hook event](#hook-events) section lists the full set of matcher values and the input schema for that event.

This example runs a linting script only when Claude writes or edits a file:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/lint-check.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you add a `matcher` field to an event without matcher support, it is silently ignored.

For tool events, you can filter more narrowly by setting the [`if` field](#common-fields) on individual hook handlers. `if` uses [permission rule syntax](/docs/en/permissions) to match against the tool name and arguments together, so `"Bash(git *)"` runs when any subcommand of the Bash input matches `git *` and `"Edit(*.ts)"` runs only for TypeScript files.

#### Match MCP tools

[MCP](/docs/en/mcp) server tools appear as regular tools in tool events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`, `PermissionDenied`), so you can match them the same way you match any other tool name.

MCP tools follow the naming pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

* `mcp__memory__create_entities`: Memory server's create entities tool
* `mcp__filesystem__read_file`: Filesystem server's read file tool
* `mcp__github__search_repositories`: GitHub server's search tool

To match every tool from a server, append `.*` to the server prefix. The `.*` is required: a matcher like `mcp__memory` or `mcp__brave-search` contains only exact-match characters, so it is compared as an exact string and matches no tool.

* `mcp__memory__.*` matches all tools from the `memory` server
* `mcp__brave-search__.*` matches all tools from a server whose name contains a hyphen
* `mcp__.*__write.*` matches any tool whose name starts with `write` from any server

Tools from a [plugin-bundled MCP server](/docs/en/mcp#plugin-provided-mcp-servers) use a scoped server segment that includes the plugin name: `mcp__plugin_<plugin-name>_<server-name>__<tool>`. A matcher written against the bare server key never fires for these tools. For a plugin named `my-plugin` that bundles a server under the key `db`, a `query` tool appears as `mcp__plugin_my-plugin_db__query`, so the matcher for every tool from that server is `mcp__plugin_my-plugin_db__.*`. Use the same scoped tool name in a handler's [`if` field](#common-fields). See [Plugin-provided MCP servers](/docs/en/mcp#plugin-provided-mcp-servers) for how the scoped name is built.

This example logs all memory server operations and validates write operations from any MCP server:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
