### Notification

Runs when Claude Code sends notifications. Matches on notification type. Omit the matcher to run hooks for all notification types.

You receive these hook events even with desktop notifications turned off: the `preferredNotifChannel` setting, including `notifications_disabled`, changes only how you're alerted, not whether your hook runs.

| Matcher | When it fires |
| :- | :- |
| `permission_prompt` | Claude needs you to approve a tool use or a sandboxed command's [network request](/docs/en/sandboxing#network-isolation), and the prompt has waited about six seconds |
| `idle_prompt` | Claude finished responding about 60 seconds ago and you haven't typed since |
| `auth_success` | Authentication completes |
| `elicitation_dialog` | An MCP server opens an elicitation form and you haven't typed for about six seconds |
| `elicitation_url_dialog` | An MCP server asks you to open a browser URL and you haven't typed for about six seconds |
| `elicitation_complete` | An MCP server reports that a [URL-mode elicitation](#elicitation-input) is complete |
| `elicitation_response` | An MCP elicitation response is sent back to the server |
| `agent_needs_input` | A background session starts waiting on your input while [agent view](/docs/en/agent-view) is open in a terminal. Also fires when a terminal session shows you an [agent team teammate's terminal setup question](/docs/en/agent-teams#choose-a-display-mode) or auto mode's notice about [classifier request charges](/docs/en/auto-mode-classifier-billing) and you haven't typed for about six seconds |
| `agent_completed` | A background session finishes or fails. Fires only while [agent view](/docs/en/agent-view) is open in a terminal |
| `quota_auto_resume_fired` | Claude Code continues your task after a claude.ai usage limit paused it: at the reset, or sooner when something you do in Claude Code during the wait, such as adding usage credits, upgrading your plan, or switching models, makes usage available again, with the [model-setting exception](/docs/en/interactive-mode#wait-for-a-usage-limit-to-reset) |
| `quota_auto_resume_stale` | A claude.ai usage limit reset while your computer slept for more than about 30 minutes. Claude Code waits for you to press `Enter` instead of continuing. After a shorter sleep it continues and fires `quota_auto_resume_fired` instead |
| `quota_auto_resume_disabled` | Claude Code ends its wait for a claude.ai usage limit without continuing your task: [`autoContinueAtUsageLimit`](/docs/en/settings-reference#autocontinueatusagelimit) turned off or the reset moved more than 24 hours away during a wait Claude Code started on its own, the continued task kept hitting the limit, or the continuation was blocked before it reached the model. Doesn't fire when you press `Esc` or `Ctrl+C`, or pick **Don't continue automatically** |

The `quota_auto_resume_fired`, `quota_auto_resume_stale`, and `quota_auto_resume_disabled` types require Claude Code v2.1.234 or later.

In terminal sessions, `permission_prompt` for a sandboxed command's network request requires Claude Code v2.1.246 or later.

`agent_needs_input` for a teammate's terminal setup question requires Claude Code v2.1.248 or later.

<Note>
  The `permission_prompt`, `idle_prompt`, `elicitation_dialog`, and `elicitation_url_dialog` types share their timing with desktop notifications, so in terminal sessions you only see them when you appear to be away from the terminal:

  * Expect `permission_prompt` once you haven't typed for about six seconds. The timer starts when the permission prompt appears, and each keystroke defers it. To run a hook immediately when Claude asks for permission to use a tool, use [PermissionRequest](#permissionrequest) instead.
  * Expect `idle_prompt` about 60 seconds after Claude finishes responding, and only if you haven't typed since and no background agent, such as a background [subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents), is still running. Claude Code doesn't send `idle_prompt` while it waits for a claude.ai usage limit to reset. When the wait ends on its own, one of the `quota_auto_resume_*` types fires instead.
  * Expect `elicitation_dialog` for an elicitation form, or `elicitation_url_dialog` for a browser URL request, once you haven't typed for about six seconds. Both share the same six-second gate as `permission_prompt`: the timer starts when the dialog appears, and each keystroke defers it.

  A permission request or elicitation that arrives while another dialog is on screen keeps the same six-second gate, timed from when the request arrives. Its notification can reach you while the request still waits behind the open dialog.
</Note>

Claude Code times `permission_prompt` differently in sessions where it sends permission requests to the Agent SDK's [`canUseTool` callback](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input), which is how Claude Desktop and the VS Code extension host Claude Code:

* Expect `permission_prompt` about six seconds after Claude asks for permission. Claude Code doesn't defer it while you type.
* If you or a [PermissionRequest](#permissionrequest) hook answer sooner, Claude Code doesn't run `permission_prompt`.
* Set [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_PERMISSION_PROMPT_NOTIFY_HOOKS`](/docs/en/env-vars) to `1` to turn `permission_prompt` off in these sessions.

Before v2.1.233, `permission_prompt` didn't fire in these sessions.

Use separate matchers to run different handlers depending on the notification type. This configuration triggers a permission-specific alert script when Claude needs permission approval and a different notification when Claude has been idle:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "permission_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/permission-alert.sh"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "idle_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/idle-notification.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Notification input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), Notification hooks receive `message` with the notification text, an optional `title`, and `notification_type` indicating which type fired.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "Notification",
  "message": "Claude needs your permission",
  "title": "Permission needed",
  "notification_type": "permission_prompt"
}
```

Notification hooks can't block or modify notifications. Claude Code discards their `systemMessage` and `continue` fields but still emits [`terminalSequence`](#emit-terminal-notifications), which is what the desktop notification example relies on. Notification hooks are intended for side effects such as forwarding the notification to an external service.

### SubagentStart

Runs when Claude spawns a subagent with the Agent tool, when Claude [resumes a subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents#resume-subagents), and each time an in-process [agent team](/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate handles a new message. Supports matchers to filter by agent type name. For built-in agents, this is the agent name like `general-purpose`, `Explore`, or `Plan`. For [custom subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents), this is the `name` field from the agent's frontmatter, not the filename.

For subagents shipped by a [plugin](/docs/en/plugins/overview), the agent type is the plugin-scoped identifier such as `my-plugin:reviewer`, not the bare frontmatter name. The colon places a plugin-scoped name on the regular-expression path, so anchor the matcher with `^` and `$` for an exact match: `^my-plugin:reviewer$`.

#### SubagentStart input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), SubagentStart hooks receive `agent_id` with the unique identifier for the subagent and `agent_type` with the agent name that the matcher filters on.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "SubagentStart",
  "agent_id": "agent-abc123",
  "agent_type": "Explore"
}
```

SubagentStart hooks can't block subagent creation, but they can inject context into the subagent. In addition to the [JSON output fields](#json-output) available to all hooks, you can return:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `additionalContext` | String added to the subagent's context at the start of its conversation, before its first prompt. See [Add context for Claude](#add-context-for-claude) |

```json theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SubagentStart",
    "additionalContext": "Follow security guidelines for this task"
  }
}
```

When the hook runs again for the same subagent, Claude Code injects the returned context only when the subagent's context doesn't already hold the copy from an earlier run. The copy injected at launch stays in place, leaving the subagent's [prompt cache](/docs/en/prompt-caching#subagents-and-the-cache) intact. After [auto-compaction](/docs/en/sub-agents#auto-compaction) discards that copy, Claude Code injects the next run's context again.

### SubagentStop

Runs when a Claude Code subagent has finished responding. Matches on agent type, same values as SubagentStart.

#### SubagentStop input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), SubagentStop hooks receive `stop_hook_active`, `agent_id`, `agent_type`, `agent_transcript_path`, and `last_assistant_message`. The `agent_type` field is the value used for matcher filtering. The `transcript_path` is the main session's transcript, while `agent_transcript_path` is the subagent's own transcript stored in a nested `subagents/` folder. The `last_assistant_message` field contains the text content of the subagent's final response, so hooks can access it without parsing the transcript file.

Not every SubagentStop event comes from a subagent Claude spawned. Claude Code also runs internal agents for some of its own features, such as [prompt suggestions](/docs/en/interactive-mode#prompt-suggestions) and [`/btw` side questions](/docs/en/interactive-mode#side-questions-with-%2Fbtw), and SubagentStop fires when one of those finishes too. For those events, `agent_type` is the agent name the session itself runs as, such as one set with [`--agent`](/docs/en/cli-reference#cli-flags) or the [`agent` setting](/docs/en/settings-reference#agent), and an empty string when the session runs without one.

A `matcher` that names agent types doesn't match an empty `agent_type`. A hook whose matcher is omitted, `""`, or `"*"`, or is a regular expression that matches an empty string, runs for events with an empty `agent_type` too.

On Claude Code v2.1.271 or later, a subagent that runs with the [`SubagentHandback`](/docs/en/tools-reference) tool delivers its report through that tool before it stops. The `last_assistant_message` field then holds the subagent's closing text, if any, which is not the delivered report. The report is that call's `message` input, which a `PreToolUse` or `PostToolUse` hook matched on `SubagentHandback` receives as `tool_input.message`.

SubagentStop hooks also receive the `background_tasks` and `session_crons` arrays described under [Stop input](#stop-input). Both arrays are scoped to the parent session, not the subagent.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../abc123.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "SubagentStop",
  "stop_hook_active": false,
  "agent_id": "def456",
  "agent_type": "Explore",
  "agent_transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../abc123/subagents/agent-def456.jsonl",
  "last_assistant_message": "Analysis complete. Found 3 potential issues...",
  "background_tasks": [],
  "session_crons": []
}
```

SubagentStop hooks use the same decision control format as [Stop hooks](#stop-decision-control), including `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` with `hookEventName` set to `"SubagentStop"`, for non-error feedback that keeps the subagent running. Returning `decision: "block"` with a `reason` keeps the subagent running and delivers `reason` to the subagent as its next instruction. A hook that blocks by exiting 2 delivers its stderr message the same way. To inject context into the parent session after a subagent returns, use a [`PostToolUse`](#posttooluse) hook on the `Agent` tool instead.

### TaskCreated

Runs when a task is being created via the `TaskCreate` tool. Use this to enforce naming conventions, require task descriptions, or prevent certain tasks from being created. In a [session without the Task tools](/docs/en/tools-reference#task-tool-availability), this event doesn't fire.

TaskCreated hooks don't support matchers and fire on every occurrence.

#### TaskCreated input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), TaskCreated hooks receive `task_id`, `task_subject`, and optionally `task_description`, `teammate_name`, and `team_name`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "TaskCreated",
  "task_id": "task-001",
  "task_subject": "Implement user authentication",
  "task_description": "Add login and signup endpoints",
  "teammate_name": "implementer",
  "team_name": "session-a1b2c3d4"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `task_id` | Identifier of the task being created |
| `task_subject` | Title of the task |
| `task_description` | Detailed description of the task. May be absent |
| `teammate_name` | Name of the teammate creating the task. May be absent |
| `team_name` | Deprecated. Session-derived team name; will be removed in a future release |

#### TaskCreated decision control

A TaskCreated hook can block the creation in two ways. Either way, Claude Code deletes the task and returns your message to Claude as the tool's error. Claude Code ignores `continue: false` from this event and Claude keeps working.

* **Exit code 2**: Claude Code returns the stderr text as the message.
* **JSON `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}`**: Claude Code returns `reason` as the message.

This example blocks tasks whose subjects don't follow the required format:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TASK_SUBJECT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.task_subject')

if [[ ! "$TASK_SUBJECT" =~ ^\[TICKET-[0-9]+\] ]]; then
  echo "Task subject must start with a ticket number, e.g. '[TICKET-123] Add feature'" >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```

### TaskCompleted

Runs when a task is being marked as completed. This fires in two situations: when any agent explicitly marks a task as completed through the TaskUpdate tool, or when an [agent team](/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate finishes its turn with in-progress tasks. Use this to enforce completion criteria like passing tests or lint checks before a task can close.

TaskCompleted hooks don't support matchers and fire on every occurrence.

#### TaskCompleted input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), TaskCompleted hooks receive `task_id`, `task_subject`, and optionally `task_description`, `teammate_name`, and `team_name`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "TaskCompleted",
  "task_id": "task-001",
  "task_subject": "Implement user authentication",
  "task_description": "Add login and signup endpoints",
  "teammate_name": "implementer",
  "team_name": "session-a1b2c3d4"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `task_id` | Identifier of the task being completed |
| `task_subject` | Title of the task |
| `task_description` | Detailed description of the task. May be absent |
| `teammate_name` | Name of the teammate completing the task. May be absent |
| `team_name` | Deprecated. Session-derived team name; will be removed in a future release |

#### TaskCompleted decision control

TaskCompleted hooks support two ways to control task completion:

* **Exit code 2**: the task is not marked as completed and the stderr message is fed back to the model as feedback.
* **JSON `{"continue": false, "stopReason": "..."}`**: when a teammate finishing its turn triggered the event, stops the teammate entirely, matching `Stop` hook behavior. The `stopReason` is shown to the user. When the `TaskUpdate` tool triggered the event, Claude Code ignores `continue: false`; exit code 2 still blocks the completion.

This example runs tests and blocks task completion if they fail:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TASK_SUBJECT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.task_subject')

# Run the test suite
if ! npm test 2>&1; then
  echo "Tests not passing. Fix failing tests before completing: $TASK_SUBJECT" >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```

### Stop

Runs when the main Claude Code agent has finished responding. Does not run if
the stoppage occurred due to a user interrupt. API errors fire
[StopFailure](#stopfailure) instead.

<Tip>
  The [`/goal`](/docs/en/goal) command is a built-in shortcut for a session-scoped prompt-based Stop hook. Use it when you want Claude to keep working toward a condition without writing hook configuration.
</Tip>

#### Stop input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), Stop hooks receive `stop_hook_active`, `last_assistant_message`, `background_tasks`, and `session_crons`. The `stop_hook_active` field is `true` when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to avoid blocking on a condition that will never resolve.

Claude Code applies an 8-consecutive-continuation cap: after stop hooks have continued the turn eight times in a row, Claude Code overrides the next block and ends the turn. The count of consecutive continuations resets each time Claude calls a tool. To raise the cap, set [`CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`](/docs/en/env-vars).

The `last_assistant_message` field contains the text content of Claude's final response, so hooks can access it without parsing the transcript file. For hooks that act on the just-completed turn, such as read-aloud or notification hooks, use this field rather than reading `transcript_path`: the transcript file isn't guaranteed to include the final message at Stop time on all versions.

The `background_tasks` and `session_crons` arrays let hooks distinguish "session is done" from "session is paused waiting for background work to wake it back up". Both arrays are present when the task registry is reachable and are empty when nothing is in flight or scheduled.

Each entry in `background_tasks` describes one in-flight task and uses these fields:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `id` | Task identifier |
| `type` | Friendly task-type label such as `shell`, `subagent`, `monitor`, `workflow`, `teammate`, `cloud session`, or `MCP task`. Each label identifies which Claude Code feature created the task. Falls back to the raw discriminant for unrecognized types |
| `status` | Current task status |
| `description` | Free-text description, capped at 1000 characters with an in-string `… [+N chars]` marker when clipped |
| `command` | Shell command line, capped at 1000 characters. Present only for `shell` tasks |
| `agent_type` | Subagent type name. Present only for `subagent` tasks |
| `server` | MCP server name. Present only for `monitor` and `MCP task` tasks |
| `tool` | MCP tool name. Present only for `monitor` and `MCP task` tasks |
| `name` | Workflow name. Present only for `workflow` tasks |

Each entry in `session_crons` describes one session-scoped scheduled wakeup, sourced from `CronCreate`, `ScheduleWakeup`, and `/loop`:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `id` | Cron task identifier |
| `schedule` | Cron expression, for example `0 9 * * 1-5` |
| `recurring` | `false` for one-shot wakeups whose schedule encodes a single fire time, `true` for tasks that re-fire on every match |
| `prompt` | Prompt submitted when the cron fires, capped at 1000 characters with the same `… [+N chars]` marker |

This example shows a Stop input with one in-flight shell task and one recurring cron:

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "Stop",
  "stop_hook_active": true,
  "last_assistant_message": "I've completed the refactoring. Here's a summary...",
  "background_tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-001",
      "type": "shell",
      "status": "running",
      "description": "tail logs",
      "command": "tail -f /var/log/syslog"
    }
  ],
  "session_crons": [
    {
      "id": "cron-001",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * 1-5",
      "recurring": true,
      "prompt": "check the build"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Stop decision control

`Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks can control whether Claude continues. In addition to the [JSON output fields](#json-output) available to all hooks, your hook script can return these event-specific fields:

| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `decision` | `"block"` prevents Claude from stopping. Omit to allow Claude to stop |
| `reason` | Required when `decision` is `"block"`. Tells Claude why it should continue |
| `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` | Non-error feedback for Claude. The conversation continues so Claude can act on it, but unlike `decision: "block"` it is shown in the transcript as hook feedback rather than a hook error |

A hook that blocks by exiting 2 routes the same way as `reason`: Claude receives the stderr message as the explanation for why it should continue.

```json theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
}
```

Use `additionalContext` when the hook is working as designed and giving Claude guidance, such as "run the test suite before finishing". It keeps the conversation going through the same loop protections as `decision: "block"`, namely the `stop_hook_active` input and the 8-consecutive-continuation cap, but the transcript labels it `Stop hook feedback` and no hook error notification is shown:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "Stop",
    "additionalContext": "Please run the test suite before finishing"
  }
}
```
