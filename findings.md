Important findings, crucial information and notable interactions from sessions. Newest first.
Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — title`, then the fact with its evidence tag (see CLAUDE.md "Evidence tags"). Promote confirmed, general facts to `knowledge/` (with the owner's approval) and note it here.

## 2026-10-06 — Glob and Grep present as dedicated tools
- In this cloud session (CC 2.1.291, Linux) the tool list contained `Glob` and `Grep` [MEASURED: session tool list, 2026-10-06, CC 2.1.291, Opus 5.5, n=1]. Related open conflict in CLAUDE.md ("Glob/Grep on Linux", O1 §2) stays open until confirmed across builds.

## 2026-10-06 — Session work is invisible to later sessions until merged into main
- Each cloud session gets its own branch cut from `origin/main` (O0 §7 [SOURCE: CE]; this session: `claude/compassionate-shannon-amdhmm` from `origin/main` 676c5b6 [MEASURED: git branch -r, git log, 2026-10-06]). KB edits and entries in this file reach the next session only after the owner merges them. Rule added to CLAUDE.md "Persistence".
